# Least slack algorithm
My shitty (and probably overcomplicated) implementation of the least slack algorithm made for OSM software at the HAN. He is not the speediest of boys and loves to do way too much sorting, but he eventually gets the job done. 

![He seeks the least slack](https://github.com/WoutNagtegaal/least_slack/assets/117655924/b2819c9b-3d2c-40cc-9e1a-046dd362cd30)

## Usage
Make sure you have a correct input file and put it in the folder of the executable. Run it from the terminal like LeastSlackAlgorithm.exe [configFilename]. The results of the algorithm will be printed on the console.

## Translation into the language of the olden days
Verily, behold my humble creation, a lamentable and perchance overly intricate rendering of the least slack algorithm, wrought for the OSM software at the esteemed HAN. This creature, slow in its movements and fond of excessive sorting endeavors, doth, in time, accomplish the appointed task.

Ensure thou possesseth a fitting input scroll, and place it within the confines of the executable's dwelling. Launch it from the terminal as 'LeastSlackAlgorithm.exe [configFilename].' Lo and behold, the fruits of the algorithm shall be proclaimed upon the console.
